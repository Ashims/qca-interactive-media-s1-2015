## Activity 1: Cool Responsive Websites

Individually:

* Google a good example of a responsive website.
* Figure out what devices the website works on using "Device Mode" in google chrome.
* Figure out what the target audience for the website is, and what advantages that particular website will get from being on each device.
* Figure out what elements are common, and what are transformed between each device (and how they're transformed).
* Figure out what *doesn't* work well.
* Make a recommendation about how they could improve it based on what you imagine their target users to be.

* **Present this back to the class! (2-3 minutes each...)**
