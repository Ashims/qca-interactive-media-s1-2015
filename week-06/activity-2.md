## Activity 2: Mobile First Thumbnailing Website Assignment

Thumbnail out your website for assignment 3 using mobile-first principals. Take into account:

* Who your target user is.
* What *you* want *them* to do.
* What devices does your user have.
* What will the user be doing when they're browsing your website.
* How can you steer your target user towards their ultimate goal on each screen.

If you don't have a website theme yet, thumbnail out a website for your final year portfolio website.
