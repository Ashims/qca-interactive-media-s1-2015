### Week 4, Semester 1, 2015

Research:

Images, Audio, Video, Forms and Accessibility

Find out the best ways to implement each in HTML & CSS (And any caveats?), and what a couple of different implementations might look like.

Also find out "how not to do it" (top mistakes people might make when using your tags/techniques).

Present this back to the class.

Set up your examples in codepen.io
