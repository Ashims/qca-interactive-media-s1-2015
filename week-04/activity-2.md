Create an interactive mosaic "Creature" out of multiple images/html elements (sourced from the web or created by you-- careful of licensing) using HTML and CSS which animates in some way when you resize the browser (Talking heads?).

* Use at least 4 different types of tags to build your creature.
* Next week at the start of the lesson we'll show them all off.
* We'll be using these as a base to build in things like animation, responsiveness and interactivity in the next few weeks.

Pro-tip. Use Firefox to test the resizing if it doesn't refresh the layout fast enough (ie, lags).

Pro-tip 2. Don't forget about PNG Transparency!
